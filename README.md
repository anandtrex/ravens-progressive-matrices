# Raven's Progressive Matrices
Designed an intelligent agent that solves Raven's progressive matrices test. My agent can parse propositional or visual inputs. [Raven's progressive matrices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven's_Progressive_Matrices) is an intelligient test used on young children. My agent uses OpenCV and JavaCV for image processing and computer vision. Some of the knowledge representations used to solve the problem include Semantic Networks, Problem Reduction, and Case-Based Reasoning. It reads in the images or text and chooses the correct answer for each problem. My agent has been tested on over 60 problems and it outputs the results in a text file. Documentation about solving a 2x1, 2x2, 3x3, and image input RPM test is provided as well.
